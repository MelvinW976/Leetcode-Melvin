class Solution:
    def removeDuplicateLetters(self, s: str) -> str:
        """
        1. args: str s
        2. remove dup letter, smallest order -> small letter at front
        3. return the ans
        
        Greedy: 尽可能保持递增， 这样是最小的，除非后面没有dup
        we take letter by letter and put them into stack: if we have next letter which decreased lexicographical order of string, we remove it from stack and put new letter. However we need to be careful: if we remove some letter from stack and it was the last occurence, then we failed: we can not finish this process. 
        """

        stack = []
        ans = ""
        visited = set()
        last_occ = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(s)}
        for i, ch in enumerate(s):
            if ch in visited: continue
            visited.add(ch)
            while stack and ch < stack[-1] and last_occ[stack[-1]] > i:
                visited.remove(stack.pop())
